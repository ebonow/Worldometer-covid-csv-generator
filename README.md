# Worldometer-covid-csv-generator
A bookmarklet designed to pull data from Worldometer stats.

### About
For those who are actively collecting COVID-19 information for each country, this bookmarklet is designed to pull several columns from a country and merge them together into CSV file available for download.

Currently, the columns supported for collecting daily information for each country are confirmed cases, deaths, and active cases. This can be further expanded as needed, but for my needs, this was sufficient.

### How to use
1. Add code as bookmarklet to your browser
2. From https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries , choose a country.
3. Click the bookmarklet.
